      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Yilkal Derseh, and I was born in January 2000G.C in Ethiopia. I am a fifth-year software engineering student at Bahir Dar University, where I have been pursuing my passion for computer science and software development since 2018G.C.

        Throughout my academic career, I have acquired a diverse set of skills in programming languages such as C++, Java, Flutter, JavaScript, VueJS, ReactJS, NodeJS, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and PHP. These skills have enabled me to work on a variety of projects and develop applications across different platforms.
        
        As a software engineering student, I have been actively involved in various extracurricular activities and competitions. I have participated in hackathons and coding competitions, where I have honed my skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork.
        
        Beyond my academic pursuits, I am also passionate about making a positive impact in my community. I have volunteered my time and skills to various community development projects, including teaching computer skills to children in my local community.
        
        As I approach the end of my studies, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I am confident that my skills, knowledge, and passion for software engineering will enable me to make a meaningful contribution to the field and to society at large.</p>

          I began my secondary education at Debre Elias Secondary and Preparatory School in 2014. During my first two years, I completed my studies in the general education track, but I later decided to specialize in the natural sciences.

In 2016, I joined the natural science department and began to focus on subjects like physics, chemistry, and biology. I found these topics to be fascinating, and I was eager to learn more about the world around me. Through hard work and dedication, I was able to excel in my studies and develop a deep understanding of the natural sciences.

In 2018, I completed my secondary education and graduated from Debre Elias Secondary and Preparatory School. My time at the school was marked by academic achievement and personal growth. I learned valuable lessons about perseverance, discipline, and the importance of hard work. These lessons have stayed with me throughout my life and have helped me achieve success in my personal and professional endeavors.

After graduating from secondary school, I went on to pursue higher education and eventually secured a job in my field of interest. I continue to be passionate about the natural sciences and look forward to making a positive impact in my community through my work.
